XR Viewer client for TapLive — Unity + OpenXR telepresence module.
# TapLive XR Viewer  
**Unity + OpenXR Client for the TapLive XR Telepresence Network**

The **TapLive XR Viewer** is the core client application for Phase 3–4 of the TapLive project.  
Its purpose is to enable immersive telepresence, real-time spatial viewing, and XR-based collaboration through Unity + OpenXR.

This repository contains the initial project structure for the Unity XR client.  
Contributors will extend this into a functional Viewer app for Meta Quest and other OpenXR-compatible devices.

- Reading spatial metadata (LBS, camera orientation, device tags)  
- Enabling telepresence-style viewing  
- Integrating with REST / WebSocket / WebRTC backends  
- Running on OpenXR-compatible hardware (Meta Quest, Pico, SteamVR, etc.)

The project will evolve with the development of Phase 3 XR modules.
