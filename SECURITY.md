## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2.  Email the maintainers immediately at `security@example.com` (Replace with actual email).
3.  Include a proof of concept or detailed steps to reproduce.

We will aim to acknowledge the report within 48 hours and provide a fix timeline within 1 week.

## Out of Scope
- Cheating in single-player mode (unless it affects multiplayer integrity).
- Local physical access attacks on the VR hardware.
